Emphasis is mine.
> In fact, these two concerns (test coverage and product quality) are independent: one can easily imagine a high-quality system running in production, delivering a lot of value to its users, and not having a single automated test at all – just delete all the tests after deploying and completing extensive validation of the system. On the other hand, **it is conceivable to achieve 100% test coverage and have an extremely brittle or unusable system; in this case the tests do not provide any value at all, and are just as useless as the system itself.**
